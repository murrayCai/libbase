# libbase . current, support freebsd only.
I am designing a new strongly and compatiable coding world,this libmc will give you something like below lists:
1. error first coding method accord by the macros
2. error  call stack looked in runtime not exception , you can completely control your code under these coding rules
3. memory completely control from the **mem_show** function, you can known what's type data and whatever malloc and free

# usage
./compile and run test_mem

# example
[a library of markdown to html](https://github.com/murraycai/libmd "libmd")
